//! Generic remote-package install / update / probe over SSH.
//!
//! Replaces the per-service "is this binary installed?" + "auto-install
//! it" patterns that were starting to duplicate across `sqlite_remote`
//! and the upcoming Software panel. Centralises:
//!
//!   * `/etc/os-release` parsing and distro-id → package-manager mapping
//!   * `command -v <bin> && <bin> --version` style presence/version probe
//!   * `systemctl is-active <unit>` lookup
//!   * `apt-get install -y` / `dnf install -y` / ... command synthesis
//!     with a `sudo -n ` prefix when the session isn't already root
//!   * Streaming stdout+stderr through a per-line callback so the UI
//!     can render progress live instead of waiting for a 30s blob
//!
//! Adding a new piece of software is data-only: append a
//! `PackageDescriptor` to the registry. The execution path here doesn't
//! special-case any single tool.

// ── Co-install recommendations (v2.10) ─────────────────────────────
//
// Static "X is commonly installed alongside Y" map. After a
// successful install, the panel checks this list and surfaces
// any unmet recommendations as a chip strip below the row.
//
// Curation rules:
//   * Suggest only descriptors already in the registry — pointing
//     users at things we can install with one click.
//   * Keep lists short (3-5 items). Long lists become noise.
//   * Don't recommend the same id back at itself or its
//     dependencies (compose for docker — that's already linked
//     through the bundle catalog, separately).

/// Topologically sort a bundle's package ids so anchors install
/// before their co-install companions.
///
/// Semantics: an edge `anchor → companion` exists iff
/// `co_install_suggestions(anchor)` lists `companion` AND both are
/// in the input. Anchors install first, companions follow.
///
/// Concretely this means a bundle that mixes `docker` and
/// `compose` in arbitrary user order always gets reordered so
/// docker installs first — the apt resolver doesn't strictly need
/// it (compose is its own package), but the result is much closer
/// to what a user reads top-to-bottom in install logs.
///
/// Stability: items not connected by any edge keep their original
/// input position (Kahn's algorithm with input-order tie-break).
/// Cycles — which the static `co_install_suggestions` map should
/// never produce, but defensive code is cheap — fall back to
/// appending in input order so we never lose a package id.
///

///   stderr still streams to the UI so the user sees *which* repo
///   broke; install proceeds against the existing
///   `/var/lib/apt/lists/` cache. If install genuinely needs a fresh
///   index for a package not in cache, it will surface its own
///   "Unable to locate package" error — which is more actionable than
///   "exit 100".
/// * **dnf / yum** — `--setopt=skip_if_unavailable=True` makes a
///   single broken repo a per-repo warning instead of a global abort,
///   matching apt's new behaviour.
/// * **apk / pacman / zypper** — these don't have a separate
///   pre-install refresh step in our flow (apk's cache is per-call,
///   pacman/zypper read the existing DB), so the broken-third-party

///
/// * Service step: `command -v systemctl >/dev/null 2>&1 &&
///   systemctl disable --now <unit>` followed by `; ` (best-effort —
///   alpine has no systemd, the unit may already be stopped, etc.).
/// * Remove step: `&&`-chained from the service step's outer `;` so
///   it always runs.
/// * Autoremove step (when requested + manager supports a separate
///   pass): `&&`-chained from remove so a failed remove doesn't
///   trigger autoremove.
/// * Data-dir step (when requested + descriptor declares any):
///   `&&`-chained at the end so a failed remove never wipes user
///   data. Each path is single-quoted.
///
/// pacman's flag matrix is unique: `-R`, `-Rs` (autoremove), `-Rn`
/// (purge), `-Rns` (both). zypper folds autoremove into
/// `--clean-deps`. apk silently ignores both flags. dnf and yum
/// each get their own `autoremove` follow-up command.
/// Test-only convenience wrapper around [`build_uninstall_command_inner`]
/// without the `cleanup_script` arg. Production callers always go
/// through the inner form so the cleanup chain is plumbed through;
/// the wrapper keeps the existing test fixtures readable.
