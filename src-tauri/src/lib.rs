// ── Host health dashboard (v2.13) ─────────────────────────────────

// Thin Tauri-command wrapper around
// `pier_core::services::host_health`. The actual TCP probe lives in
// pier-core so the frontend gets a UI-agnostic implementation that
// can be exercised by `cargo test` without spinning up Tauri.

/// Quick reachability probe across saved SSH connections.
///
/// `indices` lists which entries of the persisted connection list to
/// probe; each is checked in parallel with a TCP connect bounded by
/// `timeout_ms`. Returns one report per index in input order. The
/// command itself only errors when the connection store can't be
/// loaded — per-host failures surface inside the report rows.

// ── SFTP ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Resolve a sensible starting directory for the SFTP panel on the
/// remote host, using the already-authenticated session.
///
/// **Important caveat**: `$HOME` as reported by the server is a
/// declaration, not a guarantee. DSM in particular hands every user
/// a `$HOME` of `/var/services/homes/<user>` regardless of whether
/// that path actually exists — the server will happily tell ssh
/// "your home is X" and then print
/// `Could not chdir to home directory X: No such file or directory`
/// to the login shell. A naive `$HOME` probe would hand the SFTP
/// panel that dead path and the first `list_dir` would fail.
///
/// So instead of trusting `$HOME`, we build an ordered list of
/// candidate starting directories, and return the first one that
/// passes a cheap `test -d && test -r` probe. The list is:
///
///   1. The login shell's own `pwd` — what the terminal side lands
///      at after a real login; most robust because if `$HOME` was
///      invalid the shell already fell back to `/`.
///   2. `$HOME` as declared by the environment.
///   3. DSM-specific layout: `/volume<N>/homes/<user>` for N=1..=4,
///      which is where Synology's Home Service actually places per-
///      user directories. Probed only when the username looks safe
///      (ASCII alphanumerics and `._-` only) so we don't inject
///      weirdness into a shell-exec test.
///   4. `/volume1` — the most common top-level shared area on DSM.
///   5. `/` — always listable, last resort.
///
/// Not silver-bullet: if a user has no listable directory anywhere
/// on the host (extremely restrictive ACLs, no Home Service, no
/// share access), we still hand back `/` and the caller will see
/// whatever the server lets them see there. The point of this
/// function is to give a sane default, not to paper over
/// impossible-to-navigate filesystems.
/// Probe the remote for a sensible default starting directory.
///
/// Historically this issued 2–8 separate `exec_command` calls (one
/// each for `pwd`, `$HOME`, and one `test -d` per Synology volume
/// candidate). Every `exec_command` opens a fresh SSH channel, so
/// the cost added up to a very visible hiccup on the first SFTP
/// browse — especially over transoceanic links where each RTT was
/// 150–300 ms.
///
/// The script below walks the same candidate list inside a single
/// remote `sh -lc` invocation, `printf`s the first viable path, and
/// exits. One channel open, one round-trip. The `user` is inlined
/// because it's already validated by [`is_safe_shell_username`]
/// (ASCII alphanumerics plus `.`, `_`, `-`) — none of those
/// characters expand inside double-quoted shell context.
