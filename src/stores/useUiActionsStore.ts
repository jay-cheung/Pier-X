// ── UI action bus ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// A tiny zustand store the app uses to dispatch UI-level actions
// from anywhere in the tree without threading callback props
// through every intermediate component. Right now the only
// subscriber is `App.tsx`, which listens for password-recovery
// requests so panels (Server Monitor, Terminal placeholder) can
// open the saved-connection editor without each one needing a
// dedicated `onEditConnection` prop chain.
//
// New entries here should stay tiny — a counter that increments on
// each request, plus the payload of the latest request — so React
// only reacts when something actually fires. Prefer adding a new
// counter+payload pair over piggy-backing existing ones, so a
// listener that only cares about action X doesn't re-render when
// action Y fires.
